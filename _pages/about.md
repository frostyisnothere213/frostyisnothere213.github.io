I am a developer which specializes on coding and 3D modelling/animation. I know Python and some bits of Java (for now). I use software like PyCharm,IntelliJ,Blender to do these hobbies.

Coding
======
I started learning programming recently. I used and still sometimes use Python for some of my workloads. I also created my first program, [FrostedCalculator](https://github.com/frostyisnothere213/frosted-calculator) with Python. I moved on to Java and plan on moving onto more coding languages. You can check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/frostyisnothere213/) to see what I am doing.
